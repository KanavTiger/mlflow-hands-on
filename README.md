# MLFlow Integration for Housing Prediction Model
This repository demonstrates the use of MLFlow for tracking experiments in a data science workflow. It includes two exercises:

   1. **MLFlow Hands-on Walkthrough:** A guide for setting up and using MLFlow to track experiments.
   2. **MLFlow Integration in Housing Model:** Implementation of MLFlow in the housing prediction model, tracking parameters and metrics across data preparation, model training, and scoring.

**Requirements**
   Python 3.x
   MLFlow

**Running the Project**

   **Start MLFlow server:**
      mlflow ui
      This starts the MLFlow UI at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

   **Run scripts:**
      python House_Price_Code_With_MLFlow.py

      This main script runs the entire workflow and logs the steps under a parent MLFlow run with child runs.

**Deliverables**
   1. Link to GitHub repository for the MLFlow walkthrough (Exercise 1).
   2. Link to PR for integrating MLFlow in the housing model (Exercise 2).
